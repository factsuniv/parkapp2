# parkr_valet_test

I was unable to test the Parkr Valet application because of a persistent login issue. I could not log in with any of the provided credentials (Customer, Parker, or Admin). I tried multiple methods, including direct input, keyboard navigation, and ensuring the login modal was active, but I was always returned to the login screen. This blocked me from testing any of the application's core features. The login functionality needs to be fixed before further testing can proceed.
